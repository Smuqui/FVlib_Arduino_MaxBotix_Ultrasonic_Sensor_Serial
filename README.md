## Synopsis

Library to read the MaxBotix Ultrasonic Sensors using the serial communications. 

## Code Example

There is an example inside this git. 

## Motivation

Although the serial protocol implemented for MaxBotix is simple and clear, I decided to make the library to have the main code the maximum clean and simple as possible. 

## Installation

Copy this library in your Arduino/library folder.
